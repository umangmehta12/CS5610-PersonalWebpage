<h1>Cube Achieved!!!</h1>
<p>Finally completed cube with pure CSS.U can check it here<a href="http://net4.ccs.neu.edu/home/umang12/experiments/Exp6/cube_image.html">Cube with image</a>
I have created a class named wrapper at first, so that I can align it anywhere on the screen.
Inside div wrapper, I have created another div called cube, so that inside it I can create faces..
Note, I have given some css3 tansform property to it,
One of them is -webkit-transform-style:Preserve-3d;,It will preserve its 3D position..
And also I have give some css3 animation property to rotate it..

Inside div id cube, I have created six faces (front,back,top,bottom,left and right) And I have also given an common class face for giving
 height, width, opacity etc to all (for ease)..
And I have transformed/rotated all faces, according to it dimension..
