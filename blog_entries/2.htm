<p>I am really very sorry Professor Rasala and Professor Jose for the Stop in the Blog the last week.I was stuck up with the Microsoft Visual Studio Error.</p>
<p>I would take this opportunity to highlight a few errors in MS Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate Edition.
Firstly I had an fatal error which came into picture when I wanted to use MS Visual Studio 2012 for Login Page with Microsoft MSDN Library.
The Microsoft Visual Studio does not had the Icon for ASP.Net Configuration.
It took me days to figure out and Test it in MS Visual Studio 2012 Express Edition too.
While finding the root cause for error I made another Error i.e I pressed some keys on my Keyboard whihc enabled the Paragraph Marker,
 which constantly popped on the Design Menu of MS Visual Studio.I took the error very lightly so did not contact the professor,
 but I had updated my TA Yitao regarding the paragraph marker error.
At the end I came to conclusion that the ASP.NET Configuration works only in MS Visual Studio 2010.
So re-installed the Visual Studio and I must say its one of the worst task to install it again because its very difficult you have to debug a lot of packages.
Thank you Prof.Rasala if your documentation would not have been there it would be hell of a task to configure LINQ and SQL Access too.
